Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensured high-quality input data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data, resulting in improved model accuracy.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Identified and selected the most impactful features contributing to machinery failure, optimizing model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated its effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving a reliable model suitable for real-world applications.

Visualization with Power BI: Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize prediction results, offering clear insights into failure trends and risk factors
