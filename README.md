# [Project 1:Machine_failure_prediction](https://github.com/JishnaMR/Machine-_failure-_prediction)

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensured high-quality input data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data, resulting in improved model accuracy.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Identified and selected the most impactful features contributing to machinery failure, optimizing model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated its effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving a reliable model suitable for real-world applications.

Visualization with Power BI: Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize prediction results, offering clear insights into failure trends and risk factors

# [Project 2:SMS_Spam_Detection](https://github.com/JishnaMR/sms_spam_detection)

Data Preprocessing: Performed essential text cleaning steps, such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing, to prepare data for efficient model training.

Feature Extraction with TF-IDF: Applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert text data into numerical format, capturing the relevance of words for spam detection.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving reliable spam detection.

Implementation in Google Colab: Utilized Google Colab for seamless experimentation and model development, providing a cloud-based, easily accessible environment.

# [project 3:Business_Dashboard_in_Google_Looker_Studio](https://github.com/JishnaMR/Dashboard_with_Google_Studio)

This project involves creating a comprehensive business dashboard using Google Looker Studio. The data source for the dashboard is Google Sheets, where pivot tables were created to aggregate and summarize the data. The main objective of the dashboard is to visualize key business metrics, including sales trends, customer demographics, sales by payment method, and performance across shopping malls.

# [Project 4: AI-Powered Virtual Drawing Interface](https://github.com/JishnaMR/virtual_drawing_ml)

This project leverages real-time gesture recognition using a web camera to create a virtual drawing application. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it enables users to draw and control presentations using hand movements, offering an interactive and hands-free experience ideal for teaching and virtual presentations. The system tracks hand and finger movements to create on-screen drawings, making it a versatile tool for visual storytelling and education.

# [project 5: AI-Driven Waste Classification System](https://github.com/JishnaMR/waste_claasifer_ml_project)

This project employs machine learning and computer vision to classify solid waste into categories such as recyclable, hazardous, food, and residual. Integrated with an automated recycling bin, the system opens the correct lid based on waste type, streamlining the recycling process. Designed for both environmental impact and educational use, it offers a hands-on way for children to learn about waste management and recycling.

# [project 6: Comprehensive Sales Analysis for Business Insights](https://github.com/JishnaMR/Sales_Analysis_Excel)

This project involves a detailed analysis of sales data from January 2019, focusing on key performance indicators such as,Total sales, profit margins, and order volume,Customer segmentation and product category performance,Regional trends and payment mode analysis.
