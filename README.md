# [Project 1:Machine_failure_prediction](https://github.com/JishnaMR/Machine-_failure-_prediction)

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensured high-quality input data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data, resulting in improved model accuracy.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Identified and selected the most impactful features contributing to machinery failure, optimizing model performance.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated its effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving a reliable model suitable for real-world applications.

Visualization with Power BI: Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize prediction results, offering clear insights into failure trends and risk factors

# [Project 2:SMS_Spam_Detection](https://github.com/JishnaMR/sms_spam_detection)

Data Preprocessing: Performed essential text cleaning steps, such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing, to prepare data for efficient model training.

Feature Extraction with TF-IDF: Applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert text data into numerical format, capturing the relevance of words for spam detection.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving reliable spam detection.

Implementation in Google Colab: Utilized Google Colab for seamless experimentation and model development, providing a cloud-based, easily accessible environment.
